 - a report documenting your approach and the retrieved secret message if appropriate.

I had to change the FileReader to read to the specific path of the input.txt file, so you'll have to change that in the code if you want to run it yourself (relative pathing did not work for some reason, furthermore I had to use java 8 jdk)

I first looked up the picture that visualizes how a CBC xor protocol is decrypted and saw that from there I could retrieve the key.
Java's Xor method '^' was not implemented for byte arrays and therefore I made my own, and saw that I always needed exactly three inputs to xor, so I implemented it for three arrays.
My approach when implementing was just like in FiatShamir to do it without a for loop first until I could decrypt parts of the message correctly, then I cleaned up the code.
I was unsure if I was suppose to include my personal number in the message, so my code returns.
