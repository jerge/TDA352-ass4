 This was the one that took the longest time for me since I was tired when writing and I got very confused about which variable was which
 When I had figured out which variables where which I was better able to follow the description of the protocol that was linked.
 I used the hint and looked at the R's, saw that runs[1].R == runs[9].R and then I wrote the program imperatively for only those two cases
 I then expanded s, the proof sent back to the verifier and saw that I could isolate the secret if I were able to remove 'r'
 Afterwards I wrote it for the more general case.
